## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an FPGA Design Engineer at **intelliFPGA (USA-based, Remote)**, focused on building high-performance **AI inference accelerators** in RTL. My work sits at the intersection of hardware architecture and machine learning — designing the silicon-level engines that run AI fast and efficiently.

- 🔭 Currently building a **Systolic Array AI Accelerator** with multi-precision support (INT2 → FP32) and AXI4 integration
- 🧠 Deep interest in **AI/ML hardware acceleration**, processor microarchitecture, and FPGA-based compute
- 🤝 Open to **collaboration and learning** — especially in accelerator design, RISC-V, and HLS flows
- 🎓 B.E. Electrical Engineering — **NUST (CEME)**, Rawalpindi, Pakistan
